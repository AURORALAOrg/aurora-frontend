## Course Data Structure

Each learning area contains:

- Hero image and color scheme
- Area description and icon
- Array of courses with:
  - Unique ID and title
  - Description and learning objectives
  - Lesson count and duration
  - Difficulty level
  - Prerequisite requirements
  - Course-specific image

## User Progress Tracking

The system tracks:

- Completed courses
- Total points earned
- Unlocked courses
- Area completion percentages

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Real Images**: Replace placeholder paths with actual course images
2. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real user progress API
3. **Course Content**: Link to actual lesson content
4. **Analytics**: Track user engagement and completion rates
5. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Scalability Considerations

- Easy to add new learning areas
- Modular course structure
- Flexible prerequisite system
- Extensible point/reward system

## Usage

The component is integrated into the main course listing page with tab navigation:

- **Structured Learning Paths**: New gated course system
- **All Courses**: Original course listing functionality

## Styling

Uses Tailwind CSS with:

- Dark theme (`bg-[#0F1624]`)
- Cyan accent colors (`cyan-500`, `cyan-400`)
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Testing

Key test scenarios:

1. Course unlocking flow
2. Progress tracking accuracy
3. Search and filter functionality
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Image fallback handling
6. Reward animation display

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- Lucide React (icons)
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom hooks (useDebounce, useCoursesFilter)

## Contributing

When adding new courses or learning areas:

1. Follow the existing data structure
2. Add appropriate images
3. Update prerequisite chains
4. Test the unlock flow
5. Update this documentation
