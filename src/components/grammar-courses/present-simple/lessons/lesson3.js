  commonMistakes: [
    {
      mistake: "Wrong adverb placement with 'be' verbs",
      example: "❌ I always am tired, She usually is late",
      correction: "✅ I am always tired, She is usually late",
      explanation: "Frequency adverbs go after 'be' verbs (am, is, are), not before them."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Wrong adverb placement with main verbs",
      example: "❌ I work always hard, She studies usually late",
      correction: "✅ I always work hard, She usually studies late",
      explanation: "Frequency adverbs go before the main verb, not after it."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Using plural with 'every'",
      example: "❌ every days, every weeks, every months",
      correction: "✅ every day, every week, every month",
      explanation: "Use singular nouns with 'every' (every day, not every days)."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Wrong prepositions with time expressions",
      example: "❌ in Monday, at the morning, on night",
      correction: "✅ on Monday, in the morning, at night",
      explanation: "Use 'on' with days, 'in' with general time periods, 'at' with specific times."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Confusing frequency adverbs",
      example: "❌ I never am late (meaning: I am never late)",
      correction: "✅ I am never late",
      explanation: "Remember that 'never' is a frequency adverb and follows the same placement rules."
