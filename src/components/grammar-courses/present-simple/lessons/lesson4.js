      explanation: "Use present simple for regular routines, not present continuous."

      example: "❌ He wake up early, She go to work, It rain every day",
      correction: "✅ He wakes up early, She goes to work, It rains every day",
      explanation: "Third person singular subjects need -s ending on verbs."

      explanation: "Use present simple for current habits and routines, not past tense."

      correction: "✅ I wake up at 7 AM every day, She goes to the gym twice a week",
      explanation: "Add frequency expressions to show these are regular activities."
